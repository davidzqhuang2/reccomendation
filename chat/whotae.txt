one day the edisons couldnt find six year old al as his family called him
they were visiting als older sister and her husband on their farm
it was just outside of milan ohio
the year was 1853
suddenly als uncle had an idea
he ran out of the barn and there he found al sitting on a pile of straw
he was trying to hatch a goose egg
he had seen a hen sitting on her eggs when some baby chicks came out
al wanted to make a baby goose come out of the egg
the edisons werent suprised
they had three other children but their youngest al was the most curious 
he would be that way all of his life
the world was very different when thomas alva edison was a child no electric light to see by no recorded music to listen to no movies to watch
it was edison who made all of these possible and much more changing our lives forever
